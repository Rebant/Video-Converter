This is a GUI for the powerful command line video converter, FFmpeg.

I know that there are many video converters available online, but ever since I used one as a little kid to convert videos for my iPod… well, I wanted to make one for myself. I learned how to use the many features in the Java Swing package and also implement the runtime environment by researching the appropriate libraries and reading the documentation for FFmpeg.

Currently, this appliaction can: display a log which keeps track of everything the user has done (the user may also save the log onto his computer); convert up to ten files at one time and display which ones the user has selected in another pane; and, of course, save the video in many formats by asking for the user’s preference. There is still a lot to be done, including putting in audio and video options (like which codec to use), displaying the output for the FFmpeg window, and improving the user interface.

This was the first project that I used any GUI in.

Note: Windows only.
